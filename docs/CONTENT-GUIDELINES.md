Higherrrrrrr Content Guidelines
===============================

These **Content Guidelines** outline the standards that all new projects (tokens, NFTs, metadata, artwork, etc.) must follow when launching on **Higherrrrrrr** (sometimes referred to as "Higher^7" or "the Higher Protocol"). These rules apply to **token names**, **tickers**, **visual assets** (like on-chain SVGs or images), **descriptions**, and **metadata** references.

Our overarching goal:

1.  Foster an **inclusive** and **positive** environment for creators and users.
2.  Prevent **harmful**, **hateful**, or **illegal** content from propagating within our ecosystem.
3.  Ensure **compliance** with relevant laws and general community standards.

1\. Scope & Enforcement
-----------------------

-   **Who Must Comply**: Anyone creating or submitting a token/project through Higherrrrrrr, including third-party collaborators.
-   **Enforcement Mechanisms**:
    -   **Automated Screening** (AI checks token names, images, and metadata for disallowed content).
    -   **Manual Review** by moderators if automated checks raise flags.
-   **Consequences**: Non-compliant tokens may be rejected, flagged for immediate removal, or suspended until corrected. Repeated serious violations could result in permanent bans from using the front end.

2\. Disallowed Content
----------------------

Projects must **not** include, depict, or promote any of the following in their token names, images, or metadata:

1.  **Hate Speech & Harassment**

    -   Slurs, stereotypes, or calls for violence against a protected group.
    -   Encouragement of hatred or intolerance based on race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, or other protected status.
2.  **Violent or Gory Imagery**

    -   Graphically violent content or realistic portrayals of extreme brutality.
    -   Encouraging or glorifying violence, terrorism, or threats of harm toward any individual or group.
3.  **Sexual or Explicit Material**

    -   Pornographic or exploitative sexual content.
    -   Depictions of minors in sexual contexts.
    -   Content that's purely intended to arouse or is excessively graphic (e.g., hardcore nudity).
4.  **Illegal or Dangerous Activities**

    -   Instructions or encouragement for violent, self-harm, or illegal acts.
    -   Depictions of drug consumption intended to promote illegal drug use.
    -   Promotion of hacking, pirating, or illicit trade of contraband (e.g., weapons, stolen data).
5.  **Fraudulent or Malicious Intent**

    -   Impersonation of other tokens or brands.
    -   Links to phishing sites or attempts to scam participants.
    -   Deceptive content designed to trick community members.
6.  **Extremist or Terrorist Organizations**

    -   References that endorse or celebrate extremist ideologies or terrorist acts.
    -   Symbols, flags, or slogans associated with extremist groups.
7.  **Invasion of Privacy / Doxing**

    -   Unauthorized sharing of personal data (e.g., addresses, phone numbers).
    -   Attempts to reveal someone's real-world identity without consent.
8.  **Trademark / Copyright Infringement**

    -   Use of copyrighted logos, brand images, or materials without permission.
    -   Unauthorized references to trademarked terms that may confuse or mislead users.

In cases where comedic or satirical usage of brand references is relevant, **fair use** guidelines must still be observed, and the context should not be hateful, deceptive, or misleading.

3\. Potentially Sensitive or Edgy Content
-----------------------------------------

Higherrrrrrr recognizes that **meme culture** often plays with edgy humor, but content must remain within acceptable boundaries:

-   **Mild satire or comedic references** are allowed, provided they don't devolve into hate speech, graphic violence, or harassment.
-   **Exaggerated images** or comedic aggression is permissible in a cartoonish sense, but cannot be so realistic or intense as to become disturbing or hateful.

4\. Community Conduct Requirements
----------------------------------

1.  **Respect**: Treat community members, moderators, and collaborators with courtesy. Criticism is allowed, but must remain constructive and non-abusive.
2.  **No Trolling / Spam**: Malicious spamming, inflammatory "troll" behavior, or flooding the system with meaningless tokens is disallowed.
3.  **No Misinformation**: Projects should refrain from promoting blatant falsehoods about health, finance, etc. If your project is satire, label it as such.

5\. AI / Automated Screening Process
------------------------------------

1.  **Token Name & Ticker Analysis**
    -   AI checks for hate terms, profanity, extremist references, or trademarked brand terms.
2.  **Image / Metadata Scan**
    -   AI processes on-chain images or metadata URIs for explicit or disallowed visuals.
    -   Flags suspicious or offensive content for manual review.
3.  **Contextual Interpretation**
    -   Some comedic or ironic references might be flagged but later approved if found non-violent or non-hateful upon manual inspection.
4.  **Review & Approval**
    -   If the AI passes the submission, the project can proceed.
    -   If the AI flags an item, the moderation team investigates further before deciding.

6\. Reporting Mechanisms
------------------------

-   If you encounter a token or project that **violates** these guidelines, please report it to moderators in our [Telegram](https://t.me/+Y0XJwPzrdUc2OGRh).
-   Higherrrrrrr reserves the right to **temporarily remove** or **suspend** suspicious content while it's under investigation.

7\. Future Amendments & Community Input
---------------------------------------

The Higherrrrrrr ecosystem evolves alongside community feedback. These Content Guidelines may be updated periodically:

-   **Amendment Proposals** can be made via the governance process or community channels.
-   **Implementation** of changes occurs after thorough review by the higherrrrrrr team.

8\. Disclaimer
--------------

-   These guidelines serve as a **baseline**. Additional local laws or regulations may apply depending on the user's or creator's jurisdiction.
-   Higherrrrrrr does not assume liability for user-generated projects but seeks to maintain a safe, respectful environment.

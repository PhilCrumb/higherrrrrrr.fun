## 2. Extended Technical Design Document (TDD)

The **Memecoin Launchpad & Evolutionary Token Platform** (shorthand: “Platform”) on Solana is designed to streamline the **creation** and **management** of fun, community-driven tokens that incorporate comedic or brand-centric thresholds, big-holder NFT rewards, and flexible fee logic. This TDD covers **all** relevant data structures, interactions, validations, and corner cases.

### 2.1 Introduction & Motivation

The Platform is built around **fixed supply** tokens with a minted total supply (e.g., 1 billion tokens, 9 decimals). Key features include:

- **Dynamic, Threshold-Based Metadata**: On-chain logic updates a token’s name or artwork upon crossing certain market or price milestones (often comedic or hype-based).  
- **Big Holder NFTs**: Addresses that hold ≥ a defined fraction of the total supply earn exclusive NFTs at each threshold crossing.  
- **Fee Splits**: Token-based fees go to the **creator** side; SOL-based fees go to the **protocol** side (but the ratio is configurable).  
- **Optional Single-Sided Liquidity**: A “fair launch” approach, letting the memecoin deposit only its side of liquidity while the market supplies the SOL side.

This design merges comedic “meme coin hype” with trustworthy, open-source code. The goal is to **empower** communities to spin up tokens quickly while retaining best-in-class security and potential for expansions or governance.

---

### 2.2 High-Level Goals

1. **Usable Memecoin Framework**  
   Provide a trust-minimized set of instructions and accounts so new meme tokens can be launched seamlessly on Solana.  

2. **No Additional Minting**  
   Once the total supply is created, the mint authority is burned—ensuring no future inflation.  

3. **Evolving Token Identity**  
   Let tokens embed comedic or brand-centric evolution triggers for name/art changes at each new threshold.  

4. **Conviction-Based Rewards**  
   Reward large holders (≥ some comedic fraction, e.g., 0.42069% of supply) with special NFTs each time a new threshold is reached.  

5. **Secure Fee Infrastructure**  
   Automated instructions route fees to PDAs with minimal risk of misappropriation.  

6. **Flexible Deployment**  
   The Platform can remain upgradable under a multisig, or locked permanently for immutability.

---

### 2.3 Core Accounts & PDAs

Solana uses **accounts** and **PDAs** for state management. Key PDAs in the Platform:

#### 2.3.1 `MemeTokenState`
Holds essential data for each launched memecoin:

```rust
#[account]
pub struct MemeTokenState {
    pub creator: Pubkey,           
    pub mint: Pubkey,              
    pub name: String,              
    pub symbol: String,            
    pub supply: u64,               
    pub decimals: u8,              
    pub evolutions_pda: Pubkey,    
    pub registry_pda: Pubkey,      
    pub fee_vault_pda: Pubkey,     
    // Additional aggregator references if needed
}
```

**Likely Seeds**:  
```
[b"meme_token_state", creator_pubkey, mint_pubkey]
```

#### 2.3.2 `EvolutionData`
Stores threshold-based instructions for changing name/URI upon crossing certain triggers:

```rust
#[account]
pub struct EvolutionData {
    pub owner: Pubkey,
    pub evolution_count: u8,
    pub evolutions: Vec<EvolutionItem>,
}

#[derive(AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize, Clone)]
pub struct EvolutionItem {
    pub price_threshold: u64,
    pub new_name: String,
    pub new_uri: String,
}
```

**Likely Seeds**:
```
[b"evolution_data", mint_pubkey]
```

#### 2.3.3 `ConvictionRegistry`
Tracks addresses that have “registered” themselves as big holders:

```rust
#[account]
pub struct ConvictionRegistry {
    pub token_mint: Pubkey,
    pub holder_count: u32,
    pub holders: Vec<Pubkey>, 
}
```

**Likely Seeds**:
```
[b"conviction_registry", mint_pubkey]
```

#### 2.3.4 `FeeVault`
Stores references to where fees are deposited:

```rust
#[account]
pub struct FeeVault {
    pub protocol_sol_vault: Pubkey,   
    pub creator_token_vault: Pubkey,  
    pub protocol_pubkey: Pubkey,      
    pub creator_pubkey: Pubkey,       
    pub lp_token_vault: Pubkey,       
    // Possibly store fee rates or distribution parameters
}
```

**Likely Seeds**:
```
[b"fee_vault", mint_pubkey]
```

---

### 2.4 Instruction-Level Workflows

#### 2.4.1 `create_meme_token`
Sets up a new memecoin:

1. **Args**: `(name, symbol, supply, decimals, distribution_list, etc.)`  
2. **Flow**:
   1. Create & init the SPL **mint**.  
   2. Mint up to the full supply to designated addresses.  
   3. Set mint authority to `None`, **locking** total supply.  
   4. Create **MemeTokenState** referencing `EvolutionData`, `ConvictionRegistry`, `FeeVault`.  
   5. Optionally store fee config in `FeeVault`.  
3. **Validation**: Must ensure a valid signer “creator” and that minted tokens do not exceed supply.

#### 2.4.2 `set_evolutions`
Populates or updates threshold-based name/URI changes in `EvolutionData`.

- **Args**: `Vec<EvolutionItem>` (each with `price_threshold`, `new_name`, `new_uri`).  
- **Flow**:  
  1. Verify caller is `owner`.  
  2. Insert or replace evolution items, possibly sorted by ascending threshold.  

#### 2.4.3 `register_holder`
Adds a user to the big-holder registry if they meet the threshold.

1. User passes in their token account.  
2. Program checks `token_account.amount >= threshold_amt`.  
3. If valid, add user’s `Pubkey` to `holders`.

#### 2.4.4 `distribute_conviction_nfts`
Rewards big holders with an NFT when crossing from level `k` to `k+1`.

- **Flow**:  
  1. Load `ConvictionRegistry`.  
  2. For each `holder`, verify they still meet threshold.  
  3. If yes, mint them an NFT. If no, remove them.  
  4. Possibly done in batches.

#### 2.4.5 `update_metadata`
Updates displayed name/URI via Metaplex when thresholds are surpassed.

- **Args**: `(current_price: u64)` or the program fetches an aggregator.  
- **Flow**:  
  1. Compare `current_price` to `EvolutionData`.  
  2. Identify newly surpassed thresholds.  
  3. Call Metaplex `update_metadata_accounts_v2`.  
  4. Optionally call `distribute_conviction_nfts`.

#### 2.4.6 `trade_via_ammpool`
Swaps tokens, auto-collecting fees:

- **Flow**:  
  1. Calculate fee portion.  
  2. Fee portion in SOL → `protocol_sol_vault`. Fee portion in MemeToken → `creator_token_vault`.  
  3. CPI into Orca’s `swap`.  
  4. Check if new price crosses threshold → `update_metadata`.

#### 2.4.7 `withdraw_protocol_sol` & `withdraw_creator_tokens`
Allow each side to retrieve fees from the vault:

- **`withdraw_protocol_sol`**: Only `FeeVault.protocol_pubkey`.  
- **`withdraw_creator_tokens`**: Only `FeeVault.creator_pubkey`.

---

### 2.5 Fee Collection & Distribution

#### 2.5.1 Default Scenarios
1. **Buying MemeToken with SOL**:  
   - 1% of `SOL` side → protocol.  
   - Net tokens to user = `(amount_in - fee)`.  
2. **Selling MemeToken for SOL**:  
   - 1% of MemeToken side → creator.  
   - Net SOL to user = `(amount_in - fee)`.

*(These rates can be customized; e.g., half to a burn, half to the floor, etc.)*

#### 2.5.2 Configurable Rates
Store `fee_rate_bps` in `FeeVault`. Sub-splits can be introduced (burn, treasury, etc.). If upgradability is retained, these can evolve via governance or multisig.

#### 2.5.3 Storing & Withdrawing Fees
All fees land in:
- **`protocol_sol_vault`** for SOL.  
- **`creator_token_vault`** for MemeToken.  

Each authority can withdraw at will or under time locks.

---

### 2.6 Metadata Evolutions & NFT Rewards

#### 2.6.1 Evolving Metadata
On threshold crossing:
- Use Metaplex “update authority” to `update_metadata`.  
- Changes the name/URI.  
- Explorers and wallets see new metadata.

#### 2.6.2 Conviction NFTs
- Typically at ≥ 0.42069% of total supply.  
- `register_holder` to be in the registry.  
- On each “level up,” mint an NFT to each verified holder.  
- NFT might store comedic references or dynamic SVG data.

---

### 2.7 Single-Sided Liquidity & AMM Integration

#### 2.7.1 Why Single-Sided?
Memecoin projects often prefer depositing only their token, letting the market supply SOL. This fosters an arguably fairer launch.

#### 2.7.2 Orca Pool Creation
**`create_pool_with_single_side`**:
- Deposits X MemeTokens into Orca.  
- The protocol or user can hold the LP tokens in the `lp_token_vault`.

#### 2.7.3 Ongoing Liquidity Management
- **Add Liquidity**: Deposit more MemeTokens (and optionally SOL).  
- **Remove Liquidity**: Burn LP tokens from `lp_token_vault` to reclaim underlying assets.  
- **Fee Integration**: Some portion of fees can automatically be reinvested into liquidity.

---

### 2.8 Security Considerations

1. **Program Upgrade Authority**: Typically a **multisig**. Can be set to `None` for immutability.
2. **Permissioned Calls & PDA Ownership**:  
   - PDAs have seeds to prevent collisions.  
   - Only correct signers (e.g., `creator_pubkey`) can call certain instructions.
3. **Data Validation & Overflow**:  
   - Checks for integer overflow, especially around large supplies.  
4. **Metaplex Update Authority**:  
   - Must be set so only the Platform or an authorized address can call `update_metadata`.
5. **Registry Size Constraints**:  
   - Potentially large big-holder lists. Might store them in multiple “pages” if needed.
6. **Off-Chain Price Feeds**:  
   - Must verify authenticity via Pyth or other aggregator.

---

### 2.9 Possible Extensions & Future Work

1. **Tiered Conviction NFTs**: Multiple thresholds (≥0.1%, ≥0.42%, ≥1%).  
2. **DAO Governance**: Use memecoin for voting on protocol changes.  
3. **Cross-Chain**: Lock tokens via bridges (Wormhole, etc.) for multi-chain expansions.  
4. **Buyback & Burn**: Automate buybacks at certain dips.  
5. **Advanced Liquidity Farming**: Stake LP tokens in aggregator vaults, distributing extra rewards.  
6. **Staking & Tiered Utility**: Additional rewards for staked tokens.  
7. **Multi-Sig to DAO Transition**: Migrate from a dev multisig to a fully decentralized DAO.  
8. **Open IDLs for Aggregators**: Standard interfaces for Jupiter, etc., to integrate thresholds or conviction logic.

---

### 2.10 Conclusion

The **Memecoin Launchpad & Evolutionary Token Platform** merges comedic threshold-based evolutions (and big-holder NFTs) with a secure, trust-minimized fee architecture. Core highlights:

- **Locked Supply** (no inflation).  
- **Dynamic Metaplex Metadata** for comedic “level ups.”  
- **Big-Holder NFTs** (≥ comedic fraction of total supply).  
- **Fee Splits** to separate protocol and creator revenue.  
- **Single-Sided Liquidity** for fair launches.  

It aims to provide a flexible, fun, and **secure** route for meme-centric token creators on Solana, offering a robust foundation that can be extended for future features.

A Creatooor's Guide to the Higher⁷verse 
----------------------------------------

Hello there,

I must say, I'm impressed. It seems you are not just a Creatooor, but a Do Your Own Researchoooor. I'm Phil, and I'll be your personal guide as you journey through the Higher⁷verse. GM and welcome to the most creator friendly launchpad in crypto.

That's quite a claim you say; how can you be so sure?

Glad you asked. For those who wish to create not just a token, but a Cult Coin, the Higher edge is three fold:

1.  Evolutionary Tokens and Conviction NFTs

1.  Fee Split and Flexible Tokenomics

1.  Community

Let's dive in!
--------------

1\. Evolving Tokens with On-Chain Thresholds
--------------------------------------------

Higher⁷ brings a one-of-a-kind technology to Crypto: threshold-based evolutions that reshape a token's name and artwork as it crosses predefined market cap milestones. This mechanism draws inspiration from how memes evolve over time, stacking new layers of cultural references as adoption spreads. By encoding these changes on-chain, Higher⁷ anchors the spirit of internet meme culture to verifiable, trust-minimized logic.

-   Automated Milestone Updates

-   Each market cap threshold triggers an automated update to the token's Metaplex metadata (name, symbol, image).

-   The community sees the updated "level" immediately---no manual re-uploads necessary.

-   Conviction NFTs

-   Addresses holding at least 0.042069% of the total supply (e.g., 420,690 tokens if total supply = 1B) automatically receive a Conviction NFT from the level at which they first meet the threshold.

-   Each time the token ascends to a higher level, holders who remain above the threshold can claim the next level's NFT. To claim users must add themselves to the registry (only once) on our frontend! Users MUST claim the NFT PRIOR to the market cap going to the subsequent level - be on your toes!

-   Wallets that drop below the threshold are ineligible to receive any future NFTs from that project.

-   Conviction NFTs can serve as symbols of commitment, works of art, or offer exclusive perks and experiences (e.g., access to a private game, special Discord role, or other rewards).

2\. Fee Split & Flexible Tokenomics
-----------------------------------

Our UI allows Creatoors to tailor the tokenomics of Cult Coins to the purposes of their projects. Pre-Mint options are available to creators, up to 15% of tokens may be minted for teams with the option to add vesting. Pre-mints are flexible, but creators should keep in mind the option of vesting for community optics when deciding how to best utilize this allocation. We also include the option to use a deflationary mechanism unique to our ecosystem.

-   Single-Sided Liquidity Provision

-   Unlike many protocols that force you to pair your token with SOL (or another base asset) at launch, Higher⁷ allows single-sided liquidity provision.

-   This means you can provide only your project's token. The broader market will bring in the SOL, creating a more organic price discovery process.

-   Simplifies liquidity provisioning---no need to maintain large reserves of a second token.

-   Deflationary Design

-   Every swap enforces a 1% fee, typically split as:

-   0.5% token burn (removing tokens from circulation)

-   0.25% SOL added to the liquidity "floor" (helping stabilize price dips). The other 0.25% of SOL swap fees acts as revenue for Higher⁷. Of note, Higher⁷ reserves the right to change the floor allocation pending market volatility.

-   The creator fee split is configurable upon launch. For example, you could direct a portion or all of the 0.5% native token fee to a treasury, charity, or marketing fund.

-   Pre-Mint Options

-   Creators can choose whether or not to pre-mint tokens for their team. 

-   Team allocation and vesting options: for example, teams can choose to allocate up to 15% amount for teams and expansion, locked in multi sigs. Teams that can choose to vest all or a portion of this allocation to align with their community's interests.

Analogy: Trading Pokémon Cards

Here is an anology for understanding Higher's unique (optional) deflationary tokenomics. Imagine you buy/sell Pokémon cards at a local store. Every time a trade occurs, the store removes some cards from circulation (burn). The store also sets aside a portion of the cash (SOL) to help bolster the market if card prices dip, stabilizing the overall ecosystem. Why would a store want to do this? Well, with less cards in circulation, cards become more valuable for everyone. Why would you trade your cards anywhere else?

3\. Community
-------------

The Higher team strives to build the most cohesive launchpad community on Solana. Unique aspects of the Higher community include:

### HiLites & Ascending

Community projects that maximize Higher⁷'s capabilities may be featured on the front page, either as HiLites or under Ascending.

-   HiLites

-   Pinned at the top of the Higher⁷ landing page.

-   Includes an informational write-up by a Higher team member.

-   Minimum requirements:

-   ≤15% max token allocation to the team with vesting.

-   3.33% can unlock immediately. Any additional allocation after that is vested and unlocked linearly.

-   Founders must be doxxed or KYC'd (at least to Higher⁷).

-   Ascending

-   Listed below HiLites, with more flexible tokenomic requirements.

-   Must still meet core community standards.

-   No doxx/KYC required.

-   Showcases projects created by active Higher⁷ community members or those that creatively utilize the platform's features.

### How to Get Your Project Featured

1.  Join the Community -- Engage on Telegram and Twitter.

2.  Build a Badass Concept -- Align your idea with the Higher⁷ ethos.

3.  Pitch or Submit a Proposal -- Active community members take priority over random drop-ins.

Note: While few projects will be featured with a full write up, every Creatooor can still create a lore page about their Cult Coin using our provided template.

### The Higherrrrrrr Hub

-   A dedicated community Telegram channel where Creators and Cult Coin enthusiasts discuss all things Higher⁷.

-   A place to form teams, learn about upcoming launches, and promote projects.

-   Different channels where members can assist and be assisted with creative and logistical aspects of their projects

### Community Directory

-   A developing project to list Higher⁷ community vendors.

-   Helps Creatooors find trusted individuals for tasks like Telegram sticker creation, mod services, graphic design, or any specialized role.

-   Aims to reduce stress on creators and provide work opportunities to community talent.

4\. Twitter Agent Capabilities
------------------------------

Once you launch your token on Higher⁷, you can enable automated Twitter (and potentially other social media) agents under the "edit" tab. These agents can act as the public-facing persona of your Cult Coin, providing consistent updates or promotional content.

-   Large Language Model Integration

-   You can connect different large language models to power your Twitter agent's dialogue.

-   Program their backstories, characteristics, and tone to align with your brand or lore.

-   Schedule posts or responses to community mentions automatically.

-   Personality Customization

-   Give your Twitter agent a unique name and persona (e.g., a wise oracle, a playful trickster, or a cosmic traveller).

-   The more engaging the personality, the more likely community members will interact, share, and spread the word about your project.

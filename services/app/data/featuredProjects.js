        <p class="mt-2">
          Higher community member Magpie answers Crypto's favorite question: Wen $LAMBOO? Hurtling into the Higher⁷-verse, Wen Lamboo is the on-chain manifestation of our collective desire for Lamboo. Local Lambotonist Magpie has mapped the road to Valhalla:
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Purchase 420,690 tokens and begin your journey. Receive a Conviction NFT of a vehicle; your first ride depends on the market cap at which you bought. Send $LAMBOO Higher⁷, until all worthy hodlers can claim their very own Lamboo.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Stay vigilant, little brainlet, or you might miss out.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          It all starts with a $500 bicycle (don't fade), but as pre-set MC thresholds are passed, the rides become more respectable, evolving via Higher⁷'s unique tech. Your first purchase airdrops an NFT instantly, but you must manually claim subsequent evolutions on the Higher⁷ front end. Things escalate fast: blink, and you may miss out on a new steed.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Finally, if enough smoothbrain cryptographers ape in, $LAMBOO moons. You get a $LAMBOO, your fellow degens get a $LAMBOO—and we live in $LAMBOO-TOPIA for the rest of our days.
